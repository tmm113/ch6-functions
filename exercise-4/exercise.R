# Exercise 4: functions and conditionals

# Define a function `is_twice_as_long` that takes in two character strings, and 
# returns whether or not (e.g., a boolean) the length of one argument is greater
# than or equal to twice the length of the other.
# Hint: compare the length difference to the length of the smaller string
 is_twice_as_long <- function(str1, str2) {
       diff <- abs(nchar(str1) - nchar(str2))
       min_length <- min(nchar(str1), nchar(str2))
       diff >= min_length
  }

# Call your `is_twice_as_long` function by passing it different length strings
# to confirm that it works. Make sure to check when _either_ argument is twice
# as long, as well as when neither are!



# Define a function `describe_difference` that takes in two strings. The
# function should return one of the following sentences as appropriate
#   "Your first string is longer by N characters"
#   "Your second string is longer by N characters"
#   "Your strings are the same length!"
 describe_difference <- function(str1, str2) {
       if(nchar(str1) > nchar(str2)) {
              N <- nchar(str1) - nchar(str2)
              sentence <- paste("Your first string is longer by", N, "characters")
          } else if(nchar(str2) > nchar(str1)) {
                N <- nchar(str2) - nchar(str1)
              sentence <- paste("Your second string is longer by", N, "characters")
          } else {
                  sentence <- paste("Your strings are the same length!")
          }
         sentence
    }

# Call your `describe_difference` function by passing it different length strings
# to confirm that it works. Make sure to check all 3 conditions1
